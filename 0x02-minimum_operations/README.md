To solve this problem, we need to find the fewest number of operations required to get n characters in the file. This problem can be approached by finding the prime factors of n. The sum of these prime factors will give us the minimum number of operations needed. This is because each prime factor represents a sequence of copy and paste operations.

Here's how it works:

For each factor f of n, you perform f - 1 pastes (after one copy operation).
The total number of operations for each factor f is f (1 copy + f - 1 pastes).
The minimum number of operations is the sum of these operations for all factors.
The minOperations function will iterate through possible divisors and accumulate the number of operations needed for each divisor.
